# Weatherman

This code if run alows the user to get the weather of any desired place from around the world. I did this by first importing the `geocoder` and `requests` libraries into my python code. 

```
import geocoder
import requests
```

I obtained my weather API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). This API obtains the current weather based on latitude-longitude coordinates. This API is free to use and all you have to do to obtain it is to make a account on OpenWeather's website. From this website is where I obtained my API Key. For security purposes I have removed the API Key from my code and replaced it with "XXXXXXX".

Below is the information that returns when the code is run:
