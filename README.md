# Weatherman

This code if ran alows the user to get the weather of any desired place from around the world. I did this by first importing the `geocode` and `requests` librarys into my python code. 

```
import geocode
import requests
```

After this I obtained my weather API from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). This API obtains the current weather based on latitude-longitude coordinates. This API is free to use and all you have to do to obtain it is to make a account on OpenWeather's website.
